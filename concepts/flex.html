      <h2> Self-Respect Movement </h2>
	  <div>
	       <p> 
		       The Self-Respect Movement is a movement with the aim of achieving 
			   a society where backward castes have equal human rights and encouraging
			   backward castes to have self-respect in the context of a caste-based 
			   society that considered them to be a lower end of the hierarchy.
					
			   It was founded in 1921 by S.Ramanathan who invited E. V. Ramasamy 
			   (also called as Periyar by his devoted followers) to head the movement in 
			   Tamil Nadu, India against Brahminism. The movement was extremely 
			   influential not just in Tamil Nadu, but also overseas in countries 
			   with large Tamil populations, such as Malaysia and Singapore. 
            
		   
			   Among Singapore Indians, groups like the Tamil Reform Association, 
			   and leaders like Thamizhavel G. Sarangapani were prominent in promoting 
			   the principles of the Self-Respect Movement among the local Tamil population 
			   through schools and publications.
